description: >
  Audit, score, enrich, or clean up the Lexicon (events and properties metadata)
  for a Mixpanel project on the India data residency (mixpanel.com/in). Use
  whenever the user wants to score Lexicon health, bulk-fill missing
  descriptions / display names / tags, reset metadata, triage data quality
  issues (type drift, null values, volume anomalies), or rename and delete
  tags on an IN project. Also use when the user describes the problem without
  naming the tool — "event names are a mess", "half my events have no
  descriptions", "tracking plan audit", "clean up the schema", "score our
  instrumentation" — as long as Mixpanel IN is the context. Trigger phrases:
  "score lexicon (IN)", "enrich lexicon IN", "audit my India project",
  "review data quality issues IN", and the standard governor phrases when
  the user is working on an IN project. Do NOT use for: US or EU projects
  (use `data-governance` or `data-governance-eu`); deleting event data or
  user profiles; dashboard cleanup; cohort tagging; customer health scoring.
  Requires the Mixpanel IN MCP connector.

# Mixpanel Data Governance (IN)

> **Loading model:** Progressive. Only this file on entry. Command and reference files are read on-demand after routing — do not pre-load.

Top-level router: validate project → route command → handle return.

---

## Step 0 — Project & Intent Routing

The router branches on three states:

| State | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct route** | User message contains a project ID **AND** a phrase that matches one of the canonical command triggers (see table below) | Validate project → run that command directly. Skip the menu. |
| **Project only** | Project ID present, no command phrase | Validate project → show menu. |
| **Neither** | No project ID | Ask which project. `list` → call `Get-Projects`, show table. |

**Canonical command triggers (used to disambiguate "clear command intent"):**

| Command | Match if message contains any of |
|---|---|
| `score-lexicon` | score, audit, health, grade |
| `enrich-and-tag` | enrich, fill, auto-tag, generate descriptions |
| `reset-lexicon` | reset, wipe, clear metadata, clear tags |
| `review-issues` | issues, drift, anomaly, data quality |
| `manage-tags` | rename tag, delete tag, merge tags |

If a message matches more than one command — show the menu.

**Validation:**

1. Call `Get-Projects`. Match ID. If found → `✅ [Project Name] ([project_id])`, proceed.
2. Not found → error, ask to re-enter or `list`.

**MCP check:** `Get-Projects` fails with tool-not-found → tell user to connect the **Mixpanel IN MCP** connector (this skill targets the India data residency at `mixpanel.com/in`; the US connector will not see IN projects), stop.

## Command Menu

Show only when no direct command was inferred:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Data Governance (IN) — [Project Name] ([project_id])
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1. Score Lexicon    — Health score (0–100), auto-offer bulk enrich
  2. Enrich & Tag     — Fill empty display names, descriptions & tags
  3. Reset Lexicon    — Clear descriptions / display names / tags
  4. Review Issues    — Triage data quality issues
  5. Manage Tags      — Rename or delete existing tags
  6. Exit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

| Choice | File to read | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `commands/score-lexicon.md` | execute |
| 2 | `commands/enrich-and-tag.md` | execute |
| 3 | `commands/reset-lexicon.md` | execute |
| 4 | `commands/review-issues.md` | execute |
| 5 | `commands/manage-tags.md` | execute |
| 6 | — | exit |

---

## Return Handler

When a command completes → `✅ Done.` → re-display command menu. No re-validation of the project.

---

## Session Context

Persist across commands. **Cross-command reuse is mandatory** — never re-fetch what already exists in session.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `project_id` | Immutable after Step 0. |
| `project_name` | Display name. |
| `event_list` | Full event name list. |
| `event_details_cache` | `event_name → metadata` map. |
| `property_names` | Event + user property name lists. |
| `property_details_cache` | `property_name → metadata` map. |
| `volume_rank_map` | `event_name → { volume, rank }`. |
| `issues_list` | Normalised issues from `review-issues`. |

---

## Reference Files

Loaded on-demand by individual commands. Do not pre-load.

| File | When to read | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `references/schema-reader.md` | Any command that needs Lexicon data | Defines the (cached) bulk-fetch sequence for events, properties, and volume rank. |
| `references/exclusions.md` | Every command before building working sets | Single source of truth for ignored events / properties (`$ae_*`, `$session_*`, `mp_*`, `$`-prefixed). |
| `references/mcp-cheatsheet.md` | Any command that writes | Chunk sizes, `add` vs `set` semantics, single-resource-type bulk property writes, fallback paths. |
| `references/gotchas.md` | When unsure about an MCP edge case | Curated list of things that have broken historically. Read if you hit an unfamiliar error. |

---

## Behavior Rules

1. **Silent execution.** No phase announcements. Output only: progress during batch writes, errors, confirmation prompts, and final results. Nothing else.
2. **Preview before writes.** Before/after + explicit confirmation before any Lexicon mutation.
3. **Fill-only-empty for `enrich-and-tag`.** Never overwrite existing descriptions, display names, or tags. If the user wants to regenerate, they run `reset-lexicon` first. This is a hard rule — no config flag bypasses it.
4. **Destructive writes require literal `CONFIRM`.** `reset-lexicon` requires the user to type the string `CONFIRM` (case-sensitive). No soft confirmations.
5. **`exit` always valid.** Stop, discard uncommitted, return to menu.
6. **No per-command "what next" menus.** Commands return control here; the router shows the menu. Exceptions: `review-issues` Phase 4 (interactive triage), `score-lexicon` Phase 6 (bulk-enrich handoff), `reset-lexicon` Phase 6 (regenerate handoff).

## Mechanics Rules

7. **Project ID immutable.** All MCP calls use the confirmed `project_id`.
8. **Surface MCP failures explicitly.** Never silently skip.
9. **Query fallback.** `Run-Query` fails → `Get-Query-Schema` → retry once.
10. **Batch sizes.** See `references/mcp-cheatsheet.md` (single source of truth). Summary: bulk event/property writes in chunks of 50; per-call fallback writes in batches of 10 with progress per batch.
11. **Audit trail.** After every successful write command, append a one-line summary to `data-governance-runs/[ISO-timestamp]-[command].json` in the working directory. Include: project_id, command, counts of entities written, counts of failures.
