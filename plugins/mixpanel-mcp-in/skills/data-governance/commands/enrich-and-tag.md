# Command — Enrich & Tag Lexicon

> **Session reads:** `event_list`, `event_details_cache`, `property_names`, `property_details_cache`, `volume_rank_map`
> **Session writes:** `event_list`, `event_details_cache`, `property_names`, `property_details_cache`

Single-pass enrichment: auto-generate display names, descriptions, and tags for events and properties in one combined preview. Writes happen sequentially after a single confirm: events (bulk) → tags (bulk) → properties (bulk). Execute silently.

**Fill-only-empty guarantee:** every field write checks that the target field is currently null/empty before including it in the write payload. Existing metadata is never overwritten. Hard rule — no config flag bypasses it (use `reset-lexicon` first if regenerating).

> Apply exclusions per `references/exclusions.md` before building gap lists. Use chunk sizes, fallback paths, and tag operation semantics from `references/mcp-cheatsheet.md`.

## Phase 1 — Identify Gaps

Read `references/schema-reader.md`, fetch/reuse schema. All metadata comes back in bulk reads — no sampling.

Build three gap lists:

**Event metadata gaps:** for each event, record which of these are empty:
- `description` (null/empty)
- `display_name` (null OR equals raw event name)

**Event tag gaps:** events where `tags` is null or empty array.

**Property metadata gaps:** properties where `description` is null/empty OR `display_name` is null/empty.

If all three lists are empty → output `✅ All events and properties already have descriptions, display names, and tags.` → return to router.

---

## Phase 2 — Generate Suggestions

**Seed with business context.** Before generating, call `Get-Business-Context(project_id)` once. Capture: company name, product domain, business model, key user flows. Pass this context into every description and tag generation prompt — it produces enrichment that matches the actual product instead of generic guesses from event names.

If `Get-Business-Context` returns empty or fails → log, fall back to name-based generation only.

**Default casing:** Title Case for display names and tags. The user can override in the preview — no upfront config prompt.

**For each event gap — display name:** Convert raw name from snake_case / camelCase / kebab-case. Strip prefixes (`mp_`, `$mp_`, `$`). System events (`$`-prefixed) get readable display names.

**For each event gap — description:** Infer purpose from name + schema context + business context. 1–2 sentences, under 120 chars. Analytics-perspective framing.

**For each event tag gap — tags:** Assign 1–3 tags per event using these strategies combined:

*Prefix clustering:* `checkout_*` → "Checkout", `onboarding_*` → "Onboarding", `$mp_*` / `$ae_*` → "Mixpanel System".

*Functional domain (default suggestions — agent may propose alternatives that match the customer's domain better; customer can override in preview):*
- purchase / order / cart / payment → "Commerce"
- login / signup / auth / register → "Authentication"
- view / page / screen / navigate → "Navigation"
- click / tap / button / cta → "Engagement"
- error / fail / crash → "Errors"
- search / filter / sort / query → "Search"
- share / invite / refer → "Virality"
- notification / push / email / sms → "Messaging"
- play / watch / stream / video → "Media"
- subscribe / plan / upgrade / downgrade → "Subscription"

The taxonomy above is a starting point, not a closed list. If the business context indicates a domain not covered (e.g. fintech transactions, healthtech consults, gaming sessions), propose domain-fitting tags and surface them in the preview for the customer's call.

**For each property gap — display name and description:** Same rules as events.

Process in internal batches of 10 for generation consistency.

## Phase 3 — Combined Preview

Show everything in one table. This is the first user-visible output:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ENRICH & TAG PREVIEW — [Project Name]
  Events: [N] metadata gaps, [N] tag gaps
  Properties: [N] metadata gaps
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EVENT METADATA  ([N])
  Event Name              │ New Display Name      │ New Description
  ────────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼──────────────────────
  user_signup_complete     │ User Signup Complete  │ User completes signup flow.
  ...

EVENT TAGS  ([N])
  Event Name              │ Current Tags │ New Tags
  ────────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────
  add_to_cart              │ —            │ Commerce
  user_signup_complete     │ —            │ Authentication, Onboarding
  ...

NEW TAGS TO CREATE: Commerce, Authentication, Navigation, Engagement, Onboarding

PROPERTY METADATA  ([N])
  Property Name    │ Type  │ New Display Name │ New Description
  ─────────────────┼───────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────────
  platform         │ Event │ Platform         │ Device platform (iOS, Android, Web).
  ...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

(a) Apply all   (b) Edit specific rows   (c) Cancel   (d) Export preview as JSON
```

**Edit flow:** User references rows by number or name. Update in memory, re-display, re-confirm.

**Cancel:** Return to router.

**Export preview as JSON:** Write the preview payload (events + tag groups + properties) to `data-governance-runs/[ISO-timestamp]-enrich-preview.json` in the working directory. Confirm path to user. No writes to Mixpanel. Return to router.

---

## Phase 4 — Apply (sequential)

Execute in this order. If any step fails, log and continue — do not abort. See `references/mcp-cheatsheet.md` for chunk sizes and fallback paths.

### Step 4a — Events: metadata (bulk)

Build the events array with **only the fields that were empty** for each event:

```
events = [
  { name: "event_1", display_name: "...", description: "..." },
  { name: "event_2", description: "..." },  // display_name already existed, omit
  ...
]
```

Call `Bulk-Edit-Events(project_id, events: [...])`. Chunks of up to 50. Progress: `✅ Events: 50/112 metadata updated...`

### Step 4b — Tags: create missing tags

Compute the set of new tag names (from Phase 2 tag proposals not already in `existing_tags`). For each: `Create-Tag(project_id, name)`. Log failures, continue.

### Step 4c — Tags: assign to events (bulk, grouped)

`Bulk-Edit-Events` applies the same `tags` payload uniformly across the events list. Group events by **identical target tag set**, then one bulk call per group:

```
# group { events: [e1, e2], tags: ["Commerce"] }
Bulk-Edit-Events(
  project_id,
  events: [{name: "e1"}, {name: "e2"}],
  tags: { names: ["Commerce"], operation: "add" }
)
```

Use `operation: "add"` — never `"set"` (see `references/gotchas.md`). Chunk each group into calls of up to 50 events.

Progress: `✅ Tags: group 2/5 applied (Commerce → 18 events)...`

### Step 4d — Properties: metadata (bulk)

`Bulk-Edit-Properties` is single-resource-type. Split gaps by `Event` vs `User` and build each list including only the empty fields:

```
# one call per resource_type, chunked
Bulk-Edit-Properties(
  project_id,
  resource_type: "Event",
  properties: [
    { name: "platform", display_name: "Platform", description: "..." },
    { name: "source", description: "..." },  // display_name already existed, omit
    ...
  ]
)
```

Chunks of up to 50 per call. Progress: `✅ Properties: 50/120 metadata updated...`

If a bulk call fails, fall back to per-property `Edit-Property` for that chunk only; log and continue.

---

## Phase 5 — Update Session Cache

After all writes succeed:
- Merge new fields into `event_details_cache[event_name]` for each updated event.
- Merge new fields into `property_details_cache[property_name]` for each updated property.
- Append new tags to `existing_tags`.

---

## Phase 6 — Audit Trail

Append a one-line summary to `data-governance-runs/[ISO-timestamp]-enrich.json`:

```json
{
  "command": "enrich-and-tag",
  "project_id": "...",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-09T...",
  "event_metadata_writes": N,
  "event_tag_writes": N,
  "property_metadata_writes": N,
  "new_tags_created": ["Commerce", "Authentication"],
  "failures": []
}
```

---

## Phase 7 — Output

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✅ ENRICH & TAG COMPLETE — [Project Name]
  Event metadata:    [N]/[N]
  Event tags:        [N]/[N]  (new tags created: [N])
  Property metadata: [N]/[N]
  Failures:          [N]
  Audit log:         data-governance-runs/[file].json
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If failures > 0, list them (entity name + error). Return control to router.
